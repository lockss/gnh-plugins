# German National Hosting Plugins
Plugin scaffolding for the German National Hosting Plugins

Plugin files are located in the src and test trees under org/lockss/plugin/gnh.

Additional files can be added for different plugins by adding them in folders below that root.

You will need to generate a keystore and replace the path to the anon.keystore values in the pom file.

When building you will be asked for the password to your keystore to sign the plugin jars.

The early alpha release is missing support for json plugins and the missing support is found in the clockss directory.
